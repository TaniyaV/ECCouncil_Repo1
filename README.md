Scenario
Welcome to The Comprehensive Ethical Hacking Course! you will learn

How hackers launch attacks on different systems, computers, users, websites, and wireless networks

What tools do hackers use, why, and how they work

How to protect yourselves against these attacks

How to build your security and hacking tools with Python – taught from scratch and with no programming experience necessary!

How to create your Ethical Hacking tool portfolio.

So that you can practice all the skills and techniques in real-time by using hacking tools and attacks. We'll experience real-time hacking examples and learn how to protect ourselves against these attacks at the same time.

Objective
The objective of this lab is to learn about the essentials of Python programming language.

Overview
Ethical Hacking is the process of finding vulnerabilities in a system that an attacker can exploit and cause damage. And then, these results are used to improve the security of the network and the system. We already have many Ethical Hacking Tools available, so what’s the need for Python?

Python is used to automate the process of Ethical Hacking. Ethical Hacking is not a one-step process. There are different phases of ethical hacking and some of which you will have to conduct more than once. Ethical Hacking with Python makes this easy. To start Python programming, you have to know about the essentials.

To work on python programming efficiently, we should know the essentials required for it. It covers the basics of the requirements used for the Python programming language. In this chapter, we will go through the essentials of Python programming language.

Lab Tasks
Recommended labs that will assist you in learning about the essentials of python which includes

Useful Methods

Zip and Random

Lists Advanced

Sublime Text (Windows)

Command Prompt (Windows)

Note: Your screens might differ from that of the screenshots due to the updates in the Operating Systems, tools, and other online services demonstrated in the lab tasks.

Exercise 1: Useful Methods
Lab Scenario
In this lab, the purpose is to learn about the useful methods in python. Some of them are:

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

Other than iterators, we also get need to keep a count of iterations. Python eases the programmers’ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task. This method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerating object. This enumerated object can then be used directly for loops or converted into a list of tuples using the list() method.

Lab Objective
This lab will help you to work with the useful methods in the jupyter notebook by using python.

Lab Tasks
